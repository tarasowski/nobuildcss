```
<button type="submit">Confirm</button>
<button type="button">Edit</button>
<button type="reset">Cancel</button>
```


**Using type="submit" for primary actions, type="button" for secondary actions, and type="reset" for destructive actions is a sensible and effective design pattern for form handling.**

Color codes:
- **Black**: This button=submit is typically used for actions like saving data, sending user input, or finalizing a transaction (e.g., “Submit,” “Save,” “Register”).
- **Gray**: This button=button is often used for actions that do not involve form submission, such as opening a modal, running scripts, or any custom action (e.g., “Preview,” “Edit,” “Load More”).
- **Red**: This button=reset is typically used for actions like canceling user input or restoring form fields to their original values (e.g., “Reset,” “Clear,” “Cancel”).
