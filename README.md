- Secondary button (type="button") performs a cancel or close operation, but the functionality can be defined via JavaScript or another mechanism.
- or Secondary buttons (like type="reset") can suggest a secondary or alternative action that doesnâ€™t finalize anything, such as "Cancel", "Back", or "Reset".
